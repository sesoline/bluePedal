# MIDI BLUETOOTH PEDAL

This project use some others projects in order to create a DIY bluetooth midi pedal using ESP32 chip, programmed throught Aurduino.

Current develop is working for iOS (I haven't tried with Android devices). iOS apps where it cork fine were:
- Garageband
- JamUp
- AmpKit
- Amplitube
- ToneBrigde and so on.

however, in order to the pedal be readed for the apps, it is necessary install and run the App called "midi wrench" available into the app store

A good future devolop could be avoid to use this app
